# Python---Basic-Test-Questions

This script (saved in Jupyter Notebook and Python) goes through several activities commonly found on basic python tests.

1. Write a function to determine if two lists of numbers are equal
   (I did this several ways, first where list position makes a difference, second where it does not)

2. Write a function that counts how many times each letter in a string occurs.

3. Write a function that accepts an array of integers and returns the largest number we can get by multiplying two of them.

4. Write a function that finds the most frequent element in an array

5. Write a function that determines if its string argument is a palindrome.
